# Instructions

This is a sample repo for the purpose of being used in demos for ci/cd pipelines. 
You can find the instructions for each ci/cd tool in their own README's. 

Each pipeline consists of:

- Running tests
- Building a docker image and publishing it in Docker Hub

This means that some credentials will need to be filled in order for them to work.

## CI/CD
- [Drone](./cicd/drone/README.md)
- [Tekton](./cicd/tekton/README.md)
